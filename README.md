# Boids Simulation (Flocking Simulation) - Introduction

This is a simple boids simulation implemented in P5 JS and HTML. The simulation is based on the [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) algorithm developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986. The algorithm is based on three simple rules:

1. **Separation**: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
2. **Alignment**: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
3. **Cohesion**: steer to move toward the average position of local flockmates

## Installation

To run the simulation, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. Alternatively, you can visit the [GitHub Pages](TODO:fill this link) for this repository.

## Understanding the Simulation

The simulation is implemented in P5 JS and HTML. The simulation is contained in the `sketch.js` file. The `index.html` file contains the HTML code for the webpage. The `p5.js` file contains the P5 JS library. The `p5.dom.js` file contains the P5 JS DOM library. The `p5.sound.js` file contains the P5 JS sound library. The `p5.min.js` file contains the minified version of the P5 JS library. The `p5.dom.min.js` file contains the minified version of the P5 JS DOM library. The `p5.sound.min.js` file contains the minified version of the P5 JS sound library. The `README.md` file contains the documentation for the simulation.

## Using the Simulation

The simulation is very simple to use. The simulation will start automatically when the webpage is loaded. The simulation can be paused by pressing the `p` key. The simulation can be resumed by pressing the `p` key again. The simulation can be reset by pressing the `r` key. The simulation can be restarted by pressing the `s` key. The simulation can be sped up by pressing the `+` key. The simulation can be slowed down by pressing the `-` key.
